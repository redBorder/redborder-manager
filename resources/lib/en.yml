      message: |
        This wizard will guide you through the essential steps to configure your
        device as a Redborder node within a Redborder cluster.

        The configuration process includes the following steps:

            - Network settings: Set up your network configuration
            - Serf configuration: Establish Serf communication settings
            - System settings: Configure the hostname, domain, and DNS
            - Node mode selection: Choose the node mode, which determines
            the set of services the node will run and its weight within the cluster

        Would you like to proceed with the configuration?

    network: 
      title: "Network Configuration\n\n"
      message: |
        In the next step, you'll configure your device's network settings.

        First, you'll be asked to choose one of your interfaces to serve as the management interface. Then, you'll be prompted to select an interface for synchronization.
      error: |
        Error: No network interfaces found. The script will now exit.
    sync_network:
      title: "Synchronism Network Configuration\n\n"
      ask: |
        Would you like to automatically configure the synchronism network based on your management interface IP?
        If decide not to, you will need to manually configure it.
      demand: 
        Please configure the synchronism network.

        Select one of the device networks to designate as the synchronism network. This network is essential for connecting nodes and building the cluster. It also facilitates communication between internal services.

        In some cases, the synchronism network may not have a default gateway and could be isolated from other networks.

    serf:
      title: "Cluster Service Configuration (Serf)\n\n"
      message: 
        In this step, you will configure the Serf service, which is responsible for creating and managing the cluster. Serf coordinates communication between nodes, handles certificate exchange, and determines the initial master node during cluster formation.

      For this configuration, you will need to provide the following three parameters:

          - Synchronism network: Define the network for node synchronization.
          - Unicast/Multicast mode: Select the communication mode for cluster coordination.
          - Secret key: Set a key to encrypt Serf network traffic for secure communication.

    dns:
      title: "Configure DNS\n\n"
      message: |
        Would you like to manually configure DNS servers?

        If your network is set to Dynamic and you are receiving DNS servers automatically via DHCP, it is recommended to select 'No' for this option.
